Explain about following attributes of <input> element
required:
Ensures the input field is filled before submitting the form.
If the field is empty during submission, the browser displays an error message (usually "This field is required").
Ideal for essential information users must provide.
multiple:
Applies only to the select input type.
Allows users to select multiple options from a list.
Requires the option elements within the select to have the multiple attribute as well.
disabled:
Makes the input field inactive and uneditable.
Users cannot interact with the field.
Useful for pre-filled data, read-only information, or fields that become available under certain conditions.
readonly:
Makes the input field read-only.
Users can see the value but cannot modify it.
Often used for displaying information or data the user shouldn't change.
maxlength:
Sets the maximum number of characters a user can enter in the input field.
Prevents users from exceeding a specific length.
Particularly useful for data with a fixed format, like phone numbers or postal codes.
size:
Defines the width (in characters) of the input field.
This is a visual cue, not a strict limitation on characters.
Browsers may adjust the size based on font and layout.
Use with caution as it might not always reflect the actual displayed width.
autofocus:
Sets focus on the input field automatically when the page loads.
Useful for highlighting the first or most important field for user input.
Can be helpful for forms where immediate user interaction is desired.
pattern:
Defines a regular expression that the input value must match.
Provides advanced validation beyond simple character limits.
Ensures users enter data in a specific format (e.g., email addresses, phone numbers).
min and max:
Applicable to numeric input types like number, range, and some date variations.
min specifies the minimum allowed value.
max specifies the maximum allowed value.
Restricts user input within a specific range.
