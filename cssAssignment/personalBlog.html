                <p>Discovering poetry has been a journey of the heart. Each verse captures a fragment of my soul,
                    weaving emotions into
                    words. From the joy of a sunrise to the sorrow of a sunset, poetry breathes life into my
                    experiences. Through this blog,
                    I share my poetic musings, hoping to touch hearts and inspire others to find beauty in words</p>

                <legend class="legend-topic">Painting</legend>
                <p>Finding peace through painting has become my cherished escape. Each brushstroke on the canvas takes
                    me to a world of
                    vibrant colors and endless possibilities. Painting allows me to express emotions, capture moments,
                    and explore
                    creativity. It’s a meditative practice that transforms my stress into art, offering a joyful,
                    fulfilling way to unwind
                    and reconnect with myself.</p>

                <p>Conquering public speaking takes practice and confidence. Start small by speaking in front of friends
                    or family. Use deep breaths to stay calm, and make eye
                    contact to connect with your audience. Remember, everyone feels nervous, but each speech builds your
                    skill. fdvfbvasddffvb, and your voice will shine!</p>

                <legend class="legend-topic">Dance</legend>
                <p>Dancing is my heart's rhythm. It’s more than movement; it’s an expression of joy, pain, and every
                    emotion in between.
                    Each beat, every step, feels like a conversation with my soul. From ballet's grace to hip-hop's raw
                    energy, dance is my
                    sanctuary. It’s where I lose myself and find myself simultaneously, creating a beautiful story with
                    every move.</p>
